<p>The COVID-19 pandemic on the past 2 years had a huge impact on education. Within less than a year, the world had been pushed to its brink from being unready for remote learning to high reliance on them. Some households may not be adequate for dealing with the change. Families affected economically may not have enough resources to accommodate remote learning and may never return back to school. Depending on the country, some of the infrastructures may also not yet ready during the early days of pandemic. Moreover, the economic impact of the pandemic should not be ignored as it also affect the education sector. Poor and even some rich countries are struggling to implement policies that alleviate the Covid-19 pandemic and online education.</p>
<p>One of the facts of COVID-19 around the world is the struggle of policymakers to implement remote learning. While more than 90 percent of the countries adopted digital and/or broadcast remote learning policies, only 60 percent did so for pre-primary education. As part of these approaches to education, one policy firm, prematurely promoted remote learning in all primary schools starting in South Africa. This report argues that, due to low initial funding for this policy, there were only limited parallel policy approaches.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, not all countries even had the necessary infrastructure to accommodate online learning. Globally, 25% of rural children and young people aged 25 years or less have internet access compared to 41% of their urban peers, a difference of 16%. 3 out of 4 students who cannot be reached by the remote learning policies come from rural areas. Only 33 per cent of children and young people have internet access at home. However, some regions show a much larger gap. There is a significant gap between high-income and low-income countries, 87 per cent coverage compared to 6 per cent, respectively.</p>
<p>Even if their infrastructure is ready, in most countries, they couldn’t handle the load it should have, at least initially and may not have enough staying power. Shutting down or restricting access to the internet can be deadly during a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Human Rights Watch. Internet shutdowns block people from getting essential information and services, including in the education sector where many of humanity’s successor may be threatened.</p>
<p>Countries around the globe may also hit economically by COVID-19 which could hinder the educational process. Poorer households, especially on those countries, need an economic relief to keep the children on school. Meanwhile, 3 out of 4 students who cannot be reached by the remote learning policies come also from belonging to those poorest households. Economic relief like bailouts, UBI (Universal Basic Income), or at least government subsidies for alleviating the cost of remote learning is desperately needed for the future of younger generations.</p>
<p>COVID-19 also made widespread school closures around the world. In the United States alone, even short, unexpected school closures due to, for example, bad winter weather have been shown to negatively affect primary-school children’s learning outcomes. Longer-term disruptions, like those following destructive hurricanes and the current Pandemic, primary and secondary students’ learning can take up to two years to recover to pre-disruption levels. Many countries with long-duration school closures also have low rates of internet connectivity at home due to their economic conditions. These students missed out on both in-person classroom instruction and learning opportunities that used internet-based technologies, putting them at risk of falling behind in their education. As a result, schools had diminished in funding due to closures during COVID-19.</p>
<p>Effective COViD-19 management is also hindered by Anti-Vaxx stances and COVID-19 denial. For example, in January 2021, the former Tanzanian President John Magufuli publically doubt the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19, and even denied the existence of The Coronavirus in his country. These stances are influenced by growing anti-vaxx sentiments in western countries and as a result, hamper the overall global response toward the COVID-19 Pandemic. At the late July to early August, 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Canada was classified as a moderate mortality country and the US a high mortality country, with the estimated number of deaths per 100,000 people being 25 for Canada and 60 for the US. The reason because significantly more people from the US than Canada reported wearing masks. This may have reflected the significantly higher per capita prevalence of COVID-19 disease and mortality in the US than Canada at the time.
Education systems need alternative methods for safe and effective learning during COVID-19 pandemic and similar disasters. New analysis conducted from UNICEF shows that television and radio broadcasts have the potential to reach a majority of the world’s children, especially the most vulnerable. In Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, television would reach 80 per cent or more of the school-aged population. In countries like Georgia, Iraq, Kyrgyz Republic, Montenegro, and Tunisia, even children in poor households have high rates of access to television making it an equitable way to deliver educational content. Meanwhile, radio has an important role to play in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where it can potentially reach more than 50 per cent of school-age children in countries such as The Gambia, Suriname, Sierra Leone and Ghana. Indonesia also proposed a hybrid system, where few classes will be attended schools via face-to-face conventional classroom, while others will be attended remotely. However, this may not be different from not implementing remote learning at all and thus may increase infections as it going on.</p>
<p>In conclusion, applied research projects for learning and better alternative methods for online education in COVID-19 is more important than ever. Advancement in Tech that could improve current infrastructure must be prioritized. The government around the world must manage their education sector with more agility and better adaptation towards better technology. If no technologically more advanced methods are not available, governments around the world must be more creative in their approach and use unconventional methods, ranging from using obsolete technologies to using a hybrid between online learning and face-to-face education.</p>
